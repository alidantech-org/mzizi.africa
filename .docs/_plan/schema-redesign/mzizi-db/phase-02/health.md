# health — Phase 02

> **DEFERRED AND UNAPPROVED.** Retained for complete inventory only. Moving this proposal here does not approve it, start planning, or authorize table redesign or implementation. Older review/approval wording below is historical; this status controls.

See [Phase 02](README.md) and [the catalogue](../README.md). References to the former Person/Organization, Political/Electoral and Participation names in the retained proposal mean historical inputs now organized under Official, Politics and Accountability. Direct domain-to-Legal links in this deferred material are not current contracts; any future review must follow Reference mediation.

## Retained proposal — unchanged design


# health schema — review and approval proposal

> **PROPOSED — USER REVIEW REQUIRED.** This is the review authority for whether the schema should exist and which tables/columns it owns. No SQL or migration is authorized.

## Purpose and ownership

**Target:** Main. **Purpose:** Health conditions, surveillance and interventions. This separate schema is a proposal based on distinct lifecycle, vocabulary and queries; merging or rejection remains open. Related owners: biology,environment,geography,organization.

## Current implementation and gaps

The active manifest has 30 manifest migrations and 49 distinct CREATE TABLE declarations (49 distinct current table names) in schemas `audit`, `auth`, `engine`, `filesystem`, `geography`, `legal`, `objects`, `reference`. Generated Dryv has 124 entities (digest `e0087da9cf5b00e91f283a5501c368c7696bdd841ea30629231dc9c590f7c1ee`). Counts describe current artifacts, not target design; SQL and Dryv diverge.

- SQL declarations: None found.
- Dryv entities: None found.

The inventory does not establish live database state and may miss ALTER-only changes. Before implementation, reconcile migrations, Dryv, generated output and callers.

## Proposed relationship map

> All nodes and edges are proposals. Main schemas may use local cross-schema foreign keys; no edge crosses the Main/Operations database boundary.

## Proposed table and column review

All tables and fields are hypothetical. Every proposed business column is listed; UUIDv7 `id` is a candidate default and remains open. Record every existing field disposition: KEEP / REMOVE / RENAME / MOVE / MERGE / SPLIT / DERIVE / ADD.

### `health.conditions` — Health condition identity

- **Example:** Disease
- **Profile:** entity; planning envelope below.

| Column | Proposed type | Meaning | Nullable | Default | Relationship | Units / validation | Proposed disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | Proposed stable identity | No | Rust UUIDv7 candidate | Primary key | UUIDv7 candidate; unique and immutable after publication | ADD (proposed target field; pending user approval) |
| `code` | `text` | Condition code | No | — | — | Nonblank when required; enforce domain-specific length, normalization and controlled vocabulary | ADD (proposed target field; pending user approval) |
| `title` | `text` | Accepted name | No | — | — | Nonblank when required; enforce domain-specific length, normalization and controlled vocabulary | ADD (proposed target field; pending user approval) |
| `kind_id` | `uuid` | Condition category | No | — | FK → `reference.values` | UUID syntax; FK target must exist when the relationship is required | ADD (proposed target field; pending user approval) |

- **FK action/cardinality:** Each non-null FK is many-to-one to its named target; nullable FKs are optional. Candidate delete/update behavior is RESTRICT/NO ACTION for accepted records; cascading canonical deletion is not proposed. Confirm uniqueness and exact behavior during review.
- **Constraints:** Pathogen is referenced from Biology, not duplicated. Exact keys and cross-field checks remain for review.
- **Indexes:** primary key on `id`; candidate B-tree indexes on FK columns `kind_id` for joins and referenced-entity filters; add temporal/spatial indexes only where the stated query needs them and benchmarks support them.
- **Relationships:** resolve each FK target. Main allows cross-schema FKs. Main and Operations have no cross-database FK.
- **Evidence/time:** preserve exact source/version, observation/retrieval time, historical context and uncertainty where applicable. Approve the exact evidence path for this table.
- **Growth/storage estimate (illustrative planning envelope, not measured):** Low: initial 1,000, +200/year, peak 20/day; five-year 2,000 rows ≈ 2.0 MiB live row+index budget; Expected: initial 10,000, +2,000/year, peak 200/day; five-year 20,000 rows ≈ 19.5 MiB live row+index budget; High: initial 100,000, +20,000/year, peak 2,000/day; five-year 200,000 rows ≈ 195.3 MiB live row+index budget. Model: initial rows + annual accepted rows × 5; multiply by a per-row budget of 1 KiB including a coarse index allowance. Replace assumptions with actual samples, ingest rates and `pg_total_relation_size` before approval. Large object bytes are excluded; WAL, replicas, backups and S3 are budgeted separately.
- **Workload:** Interactive lookup by identity and approved foreign keys; batch scans for import/reconciliation. Peak-day figure above is a scenario assumption, not a service-level commitment.
- **Partitioning:** None proposed initially; decide from measured scale/query plans. Check late data and partition count.
- **Files:** originals, full-resolution geometry, arrays, media and large exports may be immutable S3 objects. Keep searchable identity, required facts, hashes, coverage, access and provenance in PostgreSQL; use manifests and selective reads.
- **Retention/risks/benchmark:** preserve accepted evidence and corrections. Review late arrivals, contention, index/partition growth and recovery. Benchmark joins, filters, spatial access, ingestion bursts, concurrent access and interrupted publication.
### `health.providers` — Health role for an organization

## Queries, lifecycle, capacity and approval

**Representative query:** What health incidents and interventions are supported by published evidence?

Lifecycle: preserve source bytes; extract into candidate revisions; validate; review or use approved deterministic checks; atomically publish; serve. Corrections create explicit versions/supersession. Preserve disagreement and uncertainty.

Capacity is unmeasured. Use low/expected/high input scenarios, explicit formulas and workload benchmarks; do not assume sizes or universal partitions.

**Status:** NOT REVIEWED. Schema existence, tables, columns, relationships, partitioning and S3 choices require user approval. Feedback: none. Approval reference/date/revision: none. Implementation authorization: not granted. Material changes reopen approval.
